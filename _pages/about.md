I am a third year PhD student in the Computer Science Department in University of Rochester, advised by Prof. [Jiebo Luo](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from Southeast University and my master degree from Zhejiang University supervised by Prof. [Jun Xiao](http://person.zju.edu.cn/en/junx). Currently my research focus on moment localization via natural language.

My CV is [here](http://sy-zhang.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
