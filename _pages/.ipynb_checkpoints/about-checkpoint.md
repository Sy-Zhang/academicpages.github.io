I am currently a research intern at Tencent AI Lab. Before that, I got my Master degree from Digital media Computing & Design Lab (DCD), College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Jun Xiao. I achieved my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Southeast University in 2015.

My research topics include Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Specifically on Action Recognition and Detection.

I will be a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department in University of Rochester starting from Fall 2018.
